/**
 A class can inherit methods, properties, and other characteristics from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a subclass, and the class it inherits from is known as its superclass. Inheritance is a fundamental behavior that differentiates classes from other types in Swift.
 
 Swift classes don’t inherit from a universal base class.
 
 Prevent a method, property, or subscript from being overridden by marking it as 'final'.
 
 Swift does not support multiple inheritance for classes, only multiple protocols (interfaces).
 
 Similarities                       Class   Struct
  - Can conform to protocols        Y       Y       sharing behavior
  - default protocol requirements   Y       Y       via protocol extensions
  - property observers (didSet,..)  Y       Y       if a var stored property
  - initializers                    Y       Y       classes with inheritance-based init rules
  - define methods, properties      Y       Y       nearly identical

 Differences in Inheritance         Class   Struct
  - Inheritance of implementation   Y       N       Structs can't inherit from other structs
  - override methods/properties     Y       N       Structs can't use override, don't have base types
  - super                           Y       N       No superclass in a struct
  - Supports polymorphism           Y       (Y)     Structs need protocol types for dynamic dispatch
  - Reference type (shared inst.)   Y       N
  - Value type (copy on assignment) N       Y
  - Deinitializers (deinit)         Y       N       Structs don't support deinit
  - Identity (===) comparison       Y       N       Structs donâ€™t have identity, only value equality
